# Casestudy

This project is to release the code used to implement three case studies: adversarial example attack, backdoor attack and Byzantine attack to demonstrate the security threats to the algricultural AI system.

The dataset used for the adversarial example attack is under the dataset folder. The other dataset for both the backdoor and Byzantine attack to Federated Learning can be downloaded from https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cassava.
